- Make sure that you are using the latest available version of YAFC.
- Specify the YAFC version on which the bug happened.

- Please check the issues of [Yafc-ce](https://github.com/have-fun-was-taken/yafc-ce/issues) and the [original Yafc](https://github.com/ShadowTheAge/yafc/issues) to see if your problem is not a duplicate of another open or closed issue.
- Give as much relevant info as possible. The better you describe the issue, the bigger the chance that someone fixes it.
- If the bug is about mods, then attach a new-game save-file so we can sync the mods with yours.
- If the bug is about your .yafc project, such as errors in calculations, then attach your .yafc file.
- Describe the steps to reproduce the issue, the expected result, and the actual result.
- If possible, please provide a minimal example to reproduce the issue. Check if the bug can be reproduced on a fresh Yafc project, and try to use as few mods as possible. For mods selection, you can copy the mods folder, select it in Yafc, and edit the file mod-list.json to enable or disable mods.
