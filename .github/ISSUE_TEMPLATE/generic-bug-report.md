- Give as much relevant info as possible. The better you describe the issue, the bigger the chance that someone fixes it.
- If the bug is about mods, then attach a new-game save-file so we can sync the mods with yours.
- If the bug is about your .yafc project, such as errors in calculations, then attach your .yafc file.

In other words, please try to reproduce the bug on a fresh Yafc project when using as few mods as possible for that.
