Version: 0.6.1
Date: Feb 2024
    Changes:
        - Add the option to specify the number of buildings that are built for a recipe. 
          If the solution requires more than that number of buildings, a warning will be shown.
        - Add filtering by factorio-type. For instance, "tree item" or "tree tech".
        - Make the milestone list scrollable and make it support more milestones.
        - YAFC:CE has an icon now!
        - Fix link summary, so it includes duplicate recipes. Previously it showed only one, which was wrong.
        - Collapse state is no longer part of the undo history.
        - Fix showing disallowed modules for modded games.
        - other minor fixes
