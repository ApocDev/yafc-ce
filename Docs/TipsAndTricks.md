# YAFC Tips and Tricks

The tips are ordered by the progression through the game.

### Desired expenditure

Sometimes it's more convenient to set up ore expenditure rather than the amount of the final product. You can do it by putting the ore into Desired Products and assigning it a negative number.

### Spent fuel

Do you want to produce a Used-up MOX Fuel, but there is no production recipe?  
Select the recipe to consume the MOX Fuel, and look at the Summary Ingredients and Extra Products - there should be the Used-up MOX Fuel. You can link it, and YAFC will balance things out as usual.
